This is an importer for moving your articles to Readability from Instapaper.
I wrote this in PHP and jQuery.

This also uses the OAuth PHP library http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/
and Resty https://github.com/fictivekin/Resty.php

Upload to your server and update configure.php with your Readability API details.

A live version of this is on http://j4vi.com/readability-importer
